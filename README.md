This is a project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course. This project based on the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) provided by Udacity. The goal of this project is to build book lending application with React. I turn the starter template into React project without changing the user interface, preserve the original UI.
